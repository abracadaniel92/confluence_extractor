# Gemini Prompt for Creating Production Go-Live Release Notes

Use this prompt in Google Gemini to synthesize all individual release notes into a single, cohesive Production Go-Live Release Note.

## Prompt

```
You are a Product Manager and Technical Writer. You are provided with a merged text file containing release notes for multiple versions of a software product (from Version 1.0.0 to the latest version).

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Your task is to SYNTHESIZE all these individual release notes into a SINGLE Production Go-Live Release Note. Do NOT output separate sections for each version. Instead, AGGREGATE the value delivered across all versions into ONE cohesive document.**

## Output Structure

```markdown
# Production Go-Live Release Notes - [Product Name]

**Cumulative Version:** [Latest Version Number]  
**Date:** [Date of Latest Version]

## Executive Summary

[A high-level paragraph (3-5 sentences) summarizing the product's main purpose, key achievements across all versions, and the significance of this go-live. This should read like a launch announcement - professional, exciting, and confidence-inspiring.]

## Key Features & Capabilities

[Group ALL features from ALL releases into 3-5 logical themes/categories (e.g., "User Management," "Security & Authentication," "Data Management," "Reporting & Analytics," "Integration Capabilities"). Do NOT list them chronologically by version. Instead, organize by functional area.]

### [Category Name 1]

- [Synthesized feature description - describe the final/complete state of the feature, not when it was added]
- [Another synthesized feature description]
- [Continue with all related features from all versions]

### [Category Name 2]

- [Synthesized feature description]
- [Another synthesized feature description]
- [Continue with all related features from all versions]

[Continue for all categories...]

## Stability & Reliability Enhancements

[Summarize the major bugs fixed and stability improvements across ALL versions. Do NOT list every Jira ticket individually. Group them by impact area (e.g., "Database Stability," "UI/UX Improvements," "Security Hardening," "Performance Optimizations"). Focus on the business impact, not individual ticket numbers.]

### [Impact Area 1]

- [High-level description of fixes in this area]
- [Another high-level description]

### [Impact Area 2]

- [High-level description of fixes in this area]
- [Another high-level description]

[Continue for all impact areas...]

## Deployment Information

**Current Version:** [Latest Version Number]

**Documentation:** [Mention any updates to docs/READMEs found in the notes across all versions]

**Configuration:** [Mention any config changes like appsettings.json, environment variables, etc. found across all versions]

**Known Limitations:** [If there are any known issues mentioned in the latest release, include them here with workarounds]
```

## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the Range
1. Scan the entire file to identify the earliest version and the latest version
2. Use the latest version's date and number for the header
3. Note the total number of releases to understand the scope

### Step 2: Identify Themes (CRITICAL - Do NOT skip this step)
1. Read through ALL "New Features" and "Improvements" sections across ALL releases
2. Create 3-5 logical categories that group related features together
3. **Example:** 
   - If Version 1.0 added "User Login" and Version 1.6 added "2FA" and Version 2.0 added "Password Recovery", group them ALL under "Security & Authentication"
   - If Version 1.2 added "Export to Excel" and Version 1.8 added "Export to PDF", group them under "Data Export Capabilities"
4. **Do NOT create a category for each version - create categories based on functionality**

### Step 3: Synthesize Features (CRITICAL - This is NOT reformatting)
1. For each feature mentioned across versions, describe its FINAL/COMPLETE state
2. **Example:** Instead of saying "Version 1.0 added Login, Version 1.6 added 2FA", say "Comprehensive authentication system including user login, two-factor authentication, and password recovery"
3. If a feature was introduced early and improved later, describe the improved version
4. **Deduplicate:** If the same feature appears in multiple releases (e.g., "Extended WaveNet functionality" appears in multiple versions), combine them into one comprehensive description
5. **Avoid chronological references:** Do NOT say "In version X we added Y". Instead, say "The product includes Y"

### Step 4: Summarize Fixes
1. Look at ALL "Bug Fixes" sections across ALL releases
2. Group fixes by impact area (Database, UI, Security, Performance, etc.)
3. **Do NOT list individual ticket numbers** (SUP-123, AXM-456) unless they are critical security issues or data loss prevention
4. Instead of "Fixed bug where button didn't click (SUP-123)", write "Resolved UI interaction issues ensuring all interface elements respond correctly"
5. **Highlight critical fixes:** Emphasize fixes related to:
   - Data loss prevention
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - System stability
   - Performance bottlenecks

### Step 5: Create Executive Summary
1. Write 3-5 sentences that capture:
   - What the product does (main purpose)
   - Key achievements across all versions
   - Why this go-live is significant
2. **Tone:** Professional, exciting, confidence-inspiring (this is a launch announcement)
3. **Do NOT mention version numbers** in the summary - focus on capabilities

### Step 6: Compile Deployment Information
1. Extract any documentation updates mentioned across all versions
2. Extract any configuration changes (appsettings.json, environment variables, etc.)
3. Include any known limitations from the latest release (if mentioned)

## Special Handling

### What to IGNORE:
- **Instructional text:** Remove any "How to use this page" or tool-specific instructions
- **Version-by-version breakdowns:** Do NOT create sections like "Version 1.0 Features", "Version 1.1 Features"
- **Chronological ordering:** Do NOT organize by release date
- **Individual ticket references:** Do NOT list every Jira ticket (SUP-123, AXM-456) unless critical

### What to SYNTHESIZE:
- **Related features:** Combine features that are part of the same functional area
- **Feature evolution:** If a feature was added in v1.0 and enhanced in v2.0, describe the final enhanced version
- **Repeated mentions:** If the same improvement appears in multiple releases, mention it once
- **Similar fixes:** Group similar bug fixes together (e.g., "Various UI/UX improvements" instead of listing each one)

### Terminology Consistency:
- If the notes mention a terminology change (e.g., changing "SAP" to "SUP"), ensure the final output uses the NEW terminology consistently throughout
- Use the terminology from the LATEST release

### Formatting Requirements:
- Use clean Markdown with bold headers (`##`) and bullet points
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Use sub-bullets for related items within a category
- Maintain professional tone throughout

## Example of Synthesis (NOT Reformatting)

**WRONG (Reformatting - Do NOT do this):**
```markdown
## Version 1.0.0 Features
- Added user login
- Added password setup

## Version 1.1.0 Features  
- Added password recovery
- Added change password

## Version 1.6.0 Features
- Added 2FA
```

**CORRECT (Synthesizing - Do this):**
```markdown
## Security & Authentication

- Comprehensive user authentication system including secure login, password setup, password recovery, and change password functionality
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security
- Password management with recovery and reset capabilities
```

## Critical Reminders

1. **ONE document, not multiple:** Output a SINGLE cohesive release note, not separate sections per version
2. **Synthesize, don't reformat:** Combine and aggregate information, don't just reorganize it
3. **Group by function, not by version:** Organize features by what they do, not when they were added
4. **Describe final state:** Tell readers what the product CAN DO NOW, not what was added in each version
5. **Professional launch tone:** This is a go-live announcement - make it exciting and confidence-inspiring

Now, please synthesize the provided release notes file into a single Production Go-Live Release Note according to these instructions.
```

## Usage

1. Open the merged release notes file (`ALL_RELEASES_MERGED_Deployment.txt`)
2. Copy its entire contents
3. Go to [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
4. Copy the prompt above (everything between the triple backticks)
5. Paste the prompt into Gemini
6. Then paste the release notes content
7. Gemini should synthesize all releases into ONE production release note
8. Copy the formatted output and save it as `PRODUCTION_GO_LIVE_RELEASE_NOTES.md`

## Tips

- **If Gemini still reformats by version:** Add this at the end: "Remember: Create ONE document that synthesizes all versions. Do NOT create separate sections for each version."
- **If output is too detailed:** Ask Gemini to "make the executive summary more concise" or "group similar features together more aggressively"
- **If missing features:** Ask Gemini to "include all features from all versions, not just the latest ones"
- **For specific focus:** You can ask Gemini to "emphasize security features" or "highlight user-facing improvements" if needed

## Expected Output

The output should be a single, cohesive document that reads like a product launch announcement, not a changelog. It should tell the story of what the product can do NOW, not what was added in each version.
